Requires python and flask. This is a flask app that provides solution steps to the 4th encounter, "Verity", of the Salvation's Edge raid in Destiny 2.
Run "python app.py" from command line, then ctrl+click the url returned to open the browser interface.
It's pretty crude, so it might break if not used right. Instructions have been supplied

Please feel free to make use of this tool, but if you do please credit me and my work!

Disclaimer: ChatGPT was used to help me convert the original app logic into a flask app.
